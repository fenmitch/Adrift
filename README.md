# Adrift - a text adventure game

Destined for Alpha Centauri, something unexpected wakes you from your cryopod.  
The success of the mission depends on your ability to fix the ship.

I wrote this during my first year of coding to help me learn git and C++

### How to run the game:
Pull and run the 10MB Docker image: 
```
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/mitchfen/adrift:latest
```
